/**
 * @file src/error-log.js
 * @module error-log
 * @description
 * Catastrophic-failure diary.  Appends structured entries to
 * `logs/error.log` (next to the diagnostic `lp-ranger.log` produced by
 * `src/log-file.js`) so the operator has a record of every catastrophic
 * failure in the CURRENT session that would otherwise be swallowed by a
 * silent `catch`.  The file is DELETED on each startup (`resetErrorLog`,
 * called from server.js / bot.js) — no rotation, no archive — so no stale
 * error from a previous run ever lingers; any still-current problem is
 * re-logged by the scans on the next run, and self-healing entries clear
 * via `clearErrorLog`.
 *
 * Reserved for CATASTROPHIC failures only.  Not for general debug, not
 * for handled retries, not for expected transient errors.  The one
 * current caller is `_recordScanFailure` in `src/bot-recorder-lifetime.js`,
 * which fires when the initial pool-wide lifetime scan aborts before
 * anything is persisted — the failure mode that produced the July-2026
 * $11.63-vs-$255.50 Fees Compounded discrepancy on Prod.
 *
 * Entry format:
 *
 *   <four blank lines>
 *   [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ] <context line>
 *   <err.stack>
 *
 * The four-line separator is by design: the file is meant for humans
 * scanning back through history, and a huge gap between entries makes
 * a new entry unmissable when the file is opened for the first time
 * in months.
