/**
 * @file test/range-override.test.js
 * @description Tests for `resolveRangeOverrideEnabled` in
 * `src/range-override.js` — the sole decider of whether a position's
 * saved Range settings apply on the next rebalance.
 *
 * The rule has three tiers and each one exists for a concrete reason:
 *
 *   1. An explicit boolean wins.  The user touched the "No Override"
 *      toggle, so their choice is authoritative even when it disagrees
 *      with what else is on the slot.
 *   2. A slot already carrying Range settings resolves to `true`.  Those
 *      slots predate the toggle; without this tier, shipping the toggle
 *      would silently stop applying settings that live positions rely
 *      on right now.
 *   3. Otherwise the shipped default — `false`, i.e. "No Override" — so
 *      a position seen for the first time re-uses its existing on-chain
 *      range rather than reshaping it.
 *
 * Tier 2 is the one a future refactor is most likely to drop, because it
 * looks redundant next to the shipped default.  It isn't.
