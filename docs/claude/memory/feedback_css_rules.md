# CSS rules

Merged from: feedback_no_inline_styles, feedback_no_css_zoom, feedback_no_important, feedback_css_classes_purpose, feedback_color_name_comments — those slugs no longer exist as
separate files; search this one.

## no inline styles

Never use inline `<style>` blocks or inline `style="..."` attributes. All styles belong in external CSS files.
**Why:** Project convention — zero inline styles. The only exception is dynamic `width` values set by JS.
**How to apply:** When creating new HTML pages (like help.html), add styles to the existing CSS files (style.css, 9mm-pos-mgr.css) or create a dedicated external CSS file.

## no css zoom

Never introduce the CSS `zoom` property anywhere in the project — not on `body`, not on any element, not as a scaling tactic for icons/modals, not as a defensive override.

**Why:** `zoom` was removed project-wide on 2026-04-20 after the legacy `body { zoom: 1.5 }` was replaced with natural-pixel authored values (Option B: scale px values 1.5×). The user explicitly wants zero `zoom` anywhere — it's non-standard, complicates measurement/math, and we've committed to straight px sizing. Concrete confirmation: removing the body zoom also fixed a Chrome password-manager autofill dropdown that had been misaligned relative to the input it was anchored to — browser UI anchors its own chrome against the real viewport, not the zoomed layout, so zoomed bodies offset these overlays.

**How to apply:** If a future task tempts me to use `zoom` (e.g., quick uniform scaling, IE-compat shim, scaling a child element), don't. Reach for `transform: scale()`, `font-size` bumps, or direct size values. Flag any PR/branch that re-introduces `zoom:` in CSS and remove it.

## no important

Never use `!important` in CSS.
**Why:** It breaks the cascade and makes styles impossible to override cleanly. Always solve specificity issues by using equal or higher specificity selectors, source order, or restructuring.
**How to apply:** When a style isn't applying, check which rule wins via specificity. Match or exceed that specificity in the override, or ensure the override CSS file loads after the one being overridden.

## css classes purpose

Don't override CSS classes to change their meaning. If a class is designed for compact text in the app (e.g., `9mm-pos-mgr-help-list` at 11px), don't override it to 22px on another page. Instead, remove the class and let that page's own CSS handle the styling via element selectors.
**Why:** User said "make them serve their purpose; don't just override them!!!"
**How to apply:** When content appears in multiple contexts needing different styling, use the class in the compact context and plain elements (styled by page-specific CSS) in the spacious context.

## color name comments

Whenever a hex code (`#D4AF37`) or RGB triple (`212;175;55`) appears in code, include the standard color name in a comment immediately adjacent — e.g.:

```js
// Antique White (#FAEBD7) on Metallic Gold (#D4AF37)
"[dust-unit-price]": "\x1b[38;2;250;235;215;48;2;212;175;55m",
```

**Why:** Hex/RGB values are unreadable at a glance. The color name (Metallic Gold, Antique White, Dirty White, Dark Forest Green, etc.) gives a reviewer instant understanding without firing up a color picker.

**How to apply:**
- Applies going forward, in any new code that uses color codes (CSS, ANSI escape sequences, JS strings, etc.).
- The user established this rule on 2026-04-28 specifically for `console.log` color codes; they explicitly said NOT to retrofit non-console-log color codes at that time.
- For new color additions: name first (or alongside) the hex/RGB. When updating an existing color, also add the name comment if missing.
- Use the standard/canonical color name (HTML/CSS named color, Pantone/common name) — capitalize the words ("Metallic Gold," not "metallic gold").
